# Simple Crossplatfrom Server-Client program
This repository contains a simple socket program which is made from scratch using libraries provided at the OS level.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It uses windows socket 2 technology for the Windows OS and UNIX based libraries for UNIX-like OS like Linux and Mac. This repo aims to use the base libraries provided at the OS level and no use of external libraries. It is part of a larger goal of building a chat room using C++ and to make a terminal based web exploitation tool.

Currently it only supports Windows, UNIX-like OS support is underway.
